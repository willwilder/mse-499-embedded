TESTING + ANALYSIS

Combined:
-Experimental Procedure
-Results
-Analysis

In order to test the performance of the system I first tuned the system,
checked step response then tested system resilience by perturbing the system

Tune the PID with the resistor
-discuss how I did the tuning
-show effect of changing PID parameters once tuning is good

Step response

Perturb the system
-water

Talk about why I got the results on a point-by-point basis from each test in
the Testing section

REAL LIFE APPLICATION

Added system to the boot heater, tuned as per previous process
Show step response
Pictures

Take another look at the steady state error

DISCUSSION

quick redux of the design process
review the test results
-PID tuning
-Perturbation
-SP change step response

Intrinsic error
-software
-control algorithm + PID parameters
-hardware

Extrinsic error from the environment

To improve the system I would make these changes:
-change software to calculate PID on interrupt timer
-add support for 1/4 degree resolution
-change the temperature sensor technology for better resolution

discuss impact of changing PID period to see response

put the controller in system with much larger time constant

Error in temperature measurement

three areas constituting design:
electrical
software
control algorithm

Improvements Section:

evaluate the design and look for where the maximum improvement comes

talk about if I need a tenth of a degree control what would i do
differently

limitations of data interchange format in 8-bit bytes.
adding more thermocouples and taking average for large

talk about how design choices impacted results of testing

summarize and explain the performance level

NEXT STEPS
Add next steps and future work to the discussion section

CONCLUSION

Kind of like an abstract
Evaluated design with tests and Parameters
Performance could be improved with software etc
